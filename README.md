## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## LaunchPad_Countdown

### Assignment Description
This assignment is the beginning of learning how to launch a rocket and launching a rocket

### Code
[Countdown code](https://github.com/rareval48/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Launch%20Pad(Countdown%201))

### Reflection
This one was really easy as I have done countdowns before and have had experience with. But for new people doing this this would be pretty easy as there is plenty of documentation on how to do for statements.

## LaunchPad_Lights

### Assignment Description
This assignment is the second assignment where we learn how to launch a rocket.

### Code
[Lights code](https://github.com/rareval48/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Launch%20Pad%20(Countdown%202))

### Reflection
This one was also really easy as I have worked with LEDs and resistors before. For the code I just used the for loop for printing the countdown and the while loop for keeping the green led on. This was pretty easy as I have done this before.

## LaunchPad_Button

### Assignment Description
This assignment is the third part of the project where we code a button to start the countdown.

### Code
[Button code](https://github.com/rareval48/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Launch%20Pad%20(Countdown%203))

### Reflection
There was a difficult problem with the code, where even though the button wasnt pressed the code would run. So I looked at some other code and saw that I had part of my code outside of the indent, so it would start and finish without thinking about the whether or not it got a signal from the button or not. So once I fixed that and the code started working I was able to start on the fourth part of the project.
